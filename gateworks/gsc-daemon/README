The Gateworks System Controller provides a host of features which can generate
interrupts.  The GSC has a single active-low interrupt to the ARM host that it
asserts when a specific interrupt condition occurs that is enabled.

The User Pushbutton is controlled by the GSC and its status is available on
gpio100 or gpio108 depending on board model.  In some cases one might want to
detect a pushbutton 'held' for a certain amount of time, which would generate
a GPIO change on the press, but no release.  In this situation the gscd
can emit hotplug events for GPIO's that don't change in a certain amount of
time.

If all your interested in is the user pushbutton, invoke gscd as:

# i2c-bus 0, host interrupt gpio1, pushbutton gpio100
gscd 0 1 --pb_gpio 100

If you want to see nochange events (ie see if a button is 'held' down for
a period of time) specify the nochange_period for the time you want to catch:
# 6 second time
gscd 0 1 --pb_gpio 100 --nochange_period 6

If you have for example an external DIO hooked to a PB and you want to monitor
that for 'held' events, pass in its bit in nochage_mask and specify a period
to emit an event.  For example, gpio101:
# monitor gpio3 (bit2 = 0x04) and emit nochange events every 6 seconds
gscd 0 1 --nochange_mask 0x04 --nochange_period 6
